# A\* Pathfinding with Cost Map

This project integrates a cost-based map with the A\* pathfinding algorithm written in python to find optimal paths while avoiding high-cost areas and obstacles.

## Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Files

- `PathFinderA_star.py`: The main script implementing the pathfinding.
- `CostMap.py`: Defines the start, goal, and cost points.

### Running the Script

Run the pathfinding script:

```bash
python PathFinderA_star.py
```
