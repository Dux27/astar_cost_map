# A\* Pathfinding with Cost Map

This project integrates a cost-based map with the A* pathfinding algorithm written in Python to find optimal paths while avoiding high-cost areas and obstacles. It is designed for Task 2 of the RoboBoat competition, where a surface vehicle navigates through a channel made of red and green buoys, avoiding obstacles (yellow buoys).

## Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Files

- `PathFinderA_star.py`: The main script implementing the pathfinding.
- `CostMap.py`: Defines the start, goal, and cost points.

### Running the Script

Run the pathfinding script:

```bash
python PathFinderA_star.py
```
